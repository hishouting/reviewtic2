modify the destination of the <B>const</B> pointer is illegal, but you can of
course copy the information out into a non-<B>const</B> variable. The compiler

returns a <B>const</B> <B>char*</B> that is created from a character array
literal. This statement actually produces the address of the character array
literal, after the compiler creates it and stores it in the static storage area.
As mentioned earlier, this character array is technically a constant, which is
properly expressed by the return value of <B>v(&#160;)</B>.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">The return value of <B>w(&#160;)</B>
requires that both the pointer and what it points to must be <B>const</B>. As
with <B>v(&#160;)</B>, the value returned by <B>w(&#160;)</B> is valid after the
function returns only because it is
<A NAME="Index1526"></A><A NAME="Index1527"></A><B>static</B>. You never want to
return pointers to local stack variables because they will be invalid after the
function returns and the stack is cleaned up. (Another common pointer you might
return is the address of storage allocated on the heap, which is still valid
after the function returns.)</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In <B>main(&#160;)</B>, the functions are
tested with various arguments. You can see that <B>t(&#160;)</B> will accept a
non-<B>const</B> pointer argument, but if you try to pass it a pointer to a
<B>const</B>, there&#8217;s no promise that <B>t(&#160;)</B> will leave the
pointer&#8217;s destination alone, so the compiler gives you an error message.
<B>u(&#160;)</B> takes a <B>const</B> pointer, so it will accept both types of
arguments. Thus, a function that takes a <B>const</B> pointer is more general
than one that does not.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">As expected, the return value of
<B>v(&#160;)</B> can be assigned only to a pointer to a <B>const</B>. You would
also expect that the compiler refuses to assign the return value of
<B>w(&#160;)</B> to a non-<B>const</B> pointer, and accepts a <B>const int*
const</B>, but it might be a bit surprising to see that it also accepts a
<B>const int*</B>, which is not an exact match to the return type. Once again,
because the value (which is the address contained in the pointer) is being
copied, the promise that the original variable is untouched is automatically
kept. Thus, the second <B>const</B> in <B>const</B> <B>int* const</B> is only
meaningful when you try to use it as an lvalue, in which case the compiler
prevents you.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

Standard argument passing<BR><A NAME="Index1528"></A></H4></FONT>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">In C it&#8217;s very common to pass by
value, and when you want to pass an address your only choice is to use a
pointer</FONT><A NAME="fnB43" HREF="#fn43">[43]</A><FONT FACE="Georgia">.
However, neither of these approaches is preferred in C++. Instead, your first
choice when passing an argument is to pass by reference, and by <B>const</B>
<A NAME="Index1529"></A>reference at that. To the client programmer, the syntax
is identical to that of passing by value, so there&#8217;s no confusion about
pointers &#8211; they don&#8217;t even have to think about
<A NAME="Index1530"></A>pointers. For the creator of the function, passing an
address is virtually always more efficient than passing an entire class object,
and if you pass by <B>const</B> reference it means your function will not change
the destination of that address, so the effect from the client
programmer&#8217;s point of view is exactly the same as pass-by-value (only more
efficient).</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Because of the syntax of references (it
looks like pass-by-value to the caller) it&#8217;s possible to pass a
temporary<A NAME="Index1531"></A><A NAME="Index1532"></A> object to a function
that takes a <B>const </B>reference, whereas you can never pass a temporary
object to a function that takes a pointer &#8211; with a pointer, the address
must be explicitly taken. So passing by reference produces a new situation that
never occurs in C: a temporary, which is always <B>const</B>, can have its
<I>address</I> passed to a function. This is why, to allow temporaries to be
passed to functions by reference, the argument must be a <B>const</B>
reference<A NAME="Index1533"></A><A NAME="Index1534"></A>. The following example

complex. The compiler can ensure the <B>const</B>ness of a built-in type but it

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">One of the places you&#8217;d like to use
a <B>const</B> for constant expressions is inside classes. The typical example
is when you&#8217;re creating an <A NAME="Index1544"></A>array inside a class
and you want to use a <B>const</B> instead of a
<A NAME="Index1545"></A><B>#define</B> to establish the array size and to use in
calculations involving the array. The array size is something you&#8217;d like
to keep hidden inside the class, so if you used a name like <B>size</B>, for
example, you could use that name in another class without a clash. The
preprocessor treats all <B>#define</B>s as global from the point they are
defined, so this will not achieve the desired effect. </FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">You might assume that the logical choice
is to place a <B>const</B> inside the class. This doesn&#8217;t produce the
desired result. Inside a class, <B>const</B> partially reverts to its meaning in
C. It allocates storage within each object and represents a value that is
initialized once and then cannot change. The use of <B>const</B> inside a class
means &#8220;This is constant for the lifetime of the object.&#8221; However,
each different object may contain a different value for that
constant.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><FONT FACE="Georgia">Thus, when you create an ordinary
(non-<B>static</B>) <B>const</B> inside a class, you cannot give it an initial
value. This initialization must occur in the constructor, of course, but in a
special place in the constructor. Because a <B>const</B> must be initialized at
the point it is created, inside the main body of the constructor the
<B>const</B> must <I>already </I>be initialized. Otherwise you&#8217;re left
with the choice of waiting until some point later in the constructor body, which
means the <B>const</B> would be un-initialized for a while. Also, there would be
nothing to keep you from changing the value of the <B>const</B> at various
places in the constructor body.</FONT><BR></P></DIV>

and it was originally developed for use in inheritance (covered in Chapter 14).
The constructor initializer list &#8211; which, as the name implies, occurs only
